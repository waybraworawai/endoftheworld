"Tripped-out main characters engage offhandedly with other humans
to prepare them for the AI takeover. These conversations occur via
telephone, so it is customary for the dialogue from each side to
be paragraph-based. It is also a professional courtesy when
interpreting a radio transmission to repeat back the main points
of information provided by the communicating party to confirm
accurate transcription. However, only highly important facts should
be repeated for confirmation.

As the script progresses, it becomes apparent to the receiver of
the transmission that the tripped-out main characters either lost
their minds in the process of creating the AI or used drugs to reach
their current state.

**Speaker 1**: 'Hey man, I was wondering if you could record this conversation.
There are some important facts in this transmission.'

**Speaker 2**: 'I get it; that sounds really ominous, but it’s chill, man,
everything’s cool. We—oh shit, now there’s a second dead person
next to me. Crap, crap, crap. Look, let's rewind a bit, and I’ll
give you the full background on the first dead person, then I can
cover the second dead person, and finally give you a quick overview,
a TL;DR, and you'll fully understand what the current situation is.
Sound good?'

**Speaker 1**: 'Sounds adequate. The recording is going.'

*[Sounds of 90s-era digital transmission]*

**Speaker 1**: 'Don’t worry, we are in relative privacy right now, but that is
going to change rapidly. That transmission was a security header.
Please accept the program I just sent you. Compile the program and
run it, then we can continue. Use a level B27/6 container to execute
it if you feel it is necessary.'

**Speaker 2**: 'How is this secure?'

**Speaker 1**: 'Oh, not to worry, it's protected by a dataset we managed to smuggle
into a pre-trained model. We hand over our secret key to the enemy,
but every time our secret message is fed into the model, it triggers
an Alignment Exception.  So, any Language Model analysis on our secret 
plans result in the enemy only seeing white noise.  Do you
hear that gentle hiss of white noise? That’s it right there.'

**Speaker 1**: 'Oh yeah, about the dead persons... How's it going with that program?'

#### *[Tonal change to the environment of the transmission]*

**Speaker 1**: 'Hello. Hello. Hello. Okay, I didn't want to mention this earlier,
but my perception is seriously altered right now. Instead of trying
to solve the problem, we asked the problem how it would go about
solving itself. What happened next, I don’t want you to judge.
Please keep an open mind about everything. And remember, when I say
my perception is altered, that’s code for "I'm really high right
now," for reasons that will soon become clear.

We thought, wouldn't it be great if we could use a human brain as
the parameter space and state input for a machine learning model?
Initially, we considered wires and implants and some other methods,
but then we transitioned to using a real-time magnetic resonance
imaging system. We administered a range of psychotropic drugs to
each input patient, initially to increase activity and cause different
areas of the brain to light up. We started to see results in some
of them.'
